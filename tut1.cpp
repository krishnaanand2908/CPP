#include<iostream> // header file, works as import in Python

int main(){ // main function is the entry point, int is integer
    std::cout<<"Krishna is a good boy"; //std is standard library from iostream and cout is a function of this standard library << is the syntax here and "Krishna is a good boy" is a string and ; means go to the next line
    return 0; // return gives the value. return 0 means the value of int is 0 which means the successfull execution of the program
} // {} are used instead of indentation
